<h2><b>Learning about Snails in the Mississippi River</b></h2>

<h3>Size</h3>  
<li>each snail is about the size of your pinky or less</li>
<li>the babies are tinier </li>

<h3>Color</h3>
<li>brown or light</li>

<h3>Snail Patterns</h3>
<li>mostly swirling</li>
<li>little tiny pointy shells with swirls inside</li>

<h3>Body</h3>

<li>Mussels are oval sized and have a little crack above their mouth</li>
<li>You also may see polyps attached to the mussels.</li>
<li>Please don't bother the mussels.</li>

<h3>Trails</h3>
<li>the snails leave sandy trails at the edge of the water or deeper</li>
<li>make sure the trails are not loop-dee trails because those are mussels and not snails</li>

<h3>Location</h3>

<li>they are found at the sand beach along the Winchell Trail</li>
<li>if you are not next to our house or further, you might not know about this Location</li>
