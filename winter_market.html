<h2>Where and When</h2>
<i>Where</i>
<ul>In an empty lot, next to John's house</ul>
<ul>If you don't know John, look for an empty lot next to an alley, with a garage that has vines coming out of it.</ul>
<ul>The vines come out only in the summer, so you might have to look for the other clues.</ul>
<i>When</i>
<ul> When the first scene of snow comes; the snow has to be three to two inches</ul>
